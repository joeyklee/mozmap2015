# Mozmap2015

## Overview:

This is the repository for a Mozfest 2015 web feature that is aimed to create an even more interactive experience! 


## Ideas:

**MozFest Tube Map:**

* At the conference people will be flying around visiting all the dozens of different sessions happening at a time. As they get to each session, they could check-in to our little map app which will map their trajectory (or path) throughout Mozfest. At the end, they could visualize their path and the paths of others to see "where they've been" during MozFest. 
	* the style of the path could look something like a subway map with lines and nodes like this [Processing sketch](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/P_3_1_2_02)).  

**Collaborative Treasure Map**:

* a little interactive "game" in which Mozfesters can check-in to their session - each check-in reveals pixel-by-pixel an image of something really really awesome ;)
* kinda like the [million-dollar homepage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Million_Dollar_Homepage)

**Collaborative MozFest Image Puzzle**:

* a little interactive puzzle that prompts people with a list of "items" to photograph throughout the conference - each photograph submitted fits into a puzzle that when completed reveals some image of something really awesome or a location to go party :)
